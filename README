The report-tv-status monitors the power consumption (as reported by a
Shelly plug).  If it is more than 15 W, the TV is on, otherwise off.
The state is reported to Home Assistant as a binary_sensor.

This requires pyShelly.git:

    git clone git@github.com:StyraHem/pyShelly.git
    cd pyShelly
    python3 setup.py build
    sudo python3 setup.py install
